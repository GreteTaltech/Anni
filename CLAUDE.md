## Project overview

This project is a web app that runs on **Railway**, not on the developer's local computer.

## Deployment

- The app is deployed on Railway **automatically from the `main` branch** of this GitHub repository.
- Every push to `main` triggers a new Railway deployment.

## Database

- The database is a **Railway PostgreSQL** database.
- It is available **only** through the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable on Railway.
- Do **not** set up a local database.
- Do **not** set up or run a local server.

## Workflow rules

1. Before every push, run `npm run build` to make sure the app builds.
2. After each finished task, **commit and push to GitHub** so that Railway deploys the new version.
